This repository contains a list of research ideas / projects about software engineering in Mozilla and in general I'd like to get answers for. I think they might benefit Mozilla, other large open source projects and the research community in general.

Each item in Ideas.md corresponds to an idea which is not answered yet (or maybe it is, but I don't know the answer yet!).

The repository also contains some documentation about some processes in Mozilla, so that, if somebody attempts to resolve these ideas or is doing other studies on Mozilla data, they don't get sidetracked by wrong assumptions.
Some of the items in the documentation are inspired from common misconceptions found in research papers.
