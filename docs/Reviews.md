## Review policies
Each patch to Firefox is reviewed by one or more developers familiar with the modified code (module peers or module owners).

## Splinter
Splinter \[1\] is a review interface which is built-in in Bugzilla. Mozilla still supports uploading patches to review on Bugzilla, even though the suggested review tool is now Phabricator.

## MozReview
MozReview \[2\] is a fork of ReviewBoard which has recently been deprecated in favor of Phabricator. It has been used by developers for a few years, so any study should include data coming from this tool.

## Phabricator
Mozilla's suggested review tool, hosted at \[3\]. Lando \[4\] is the tool that helps landing Phabricator differentials into Mozilla's VCS.
